# odin-calculator

This is my fifth project for The Odin Project, and the last one for the 
"Foundations" section of the course!

I will be making a very simple online calculator. This project will allow
me to practice and consolidate all of the HTML, CSS and Javascript I have
learnt in The Odin Project so far.
